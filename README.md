Final Recommendations Summary for Cybersecurity:
Add more data to reduce false alarms: Use information like user behavior and device data to help the model make better decisions.
Combine different detection methods: Use multiple security checks to make sure real threats donâ€™t get missed.
Automate low-risk alerts: For harmless activities that look suspicious, let the system handle them automatically so your security team can focus on real threats.

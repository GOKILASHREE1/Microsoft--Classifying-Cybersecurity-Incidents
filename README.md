Cybersecurity Incident Detection: XGBoost Model
Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using XGBoost to detect and classify cybersecurity incidents using a dataset consisting of various features such as organizational ID, alert titles, incident IDs, categories, and more. The goal is to identify and classify incidents as BenignPositive, FalsePositive, or TruePositive, with high accuracy while minimizing false positives and false negatives, thus improving the efficiency of security incident response.

The XGBoost model was trained on a dataset of over 2 million records, where incidents are classified based on various cybersecurity features. The model achieves an accuracy of 87.65% with balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Project Objectives
Accurate Incident Detection: Build a model that can detect and classify cybersecurity incidents as benign, false positive, or true positive.
Class Imbalance Handling: Handle the inherent class imbalance in cybersecurity data, where true positive cases are relatively rare compared to benign or false positives.
Feature Importance and Optimization: Use XGBoost's feature importance capabilities to identify key factors in predicting incidents.
Visualize Results: Visualize model performance using confusion matrices and feature importance charts.
Provide Recommendations: Offer insights to improve the cybersecurity systems' performance, focusing on reducing false positives (false alarms).
Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to cybersecurity incidents, such as:

OrgId: Identifier for the organization.
DetectorId: Identifier for the detection system.
AlertTitle: The title or description of the alert.
AlertId: Unique identifier for the alert.
Category: Category of the alert.
IncidentId: Identifier for the specific incident.
EntityType: The type of entity involved in the incident (e.g., user, application).
Timestamp Features: Including the day, hour, minute, second, and weekday.
The target variable, IncidentGrade, categorizes each incident into three classes:

BenignPositive: Harmless activity that looks like a threat but is benign.
FalsePositive: Activity incorrectly flagged as a threat but is not harmful.
TruePositive: Genuine threat correctly identified as a security incident.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Label Encoding: All categorical features were label-encoded.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was used to standardize all features for model training.
Handling Class Imbalance: SMOTE and additional class weights were applied to handle class imbalance.
Modeling:

XGBoost Model: XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle imbalanced data and provide feature importance insights.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters such as learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators, and colsample_bytree were tuned to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.
F1 Score (Weighted): Harmonic mean of precision and recall, accounting for class imbalance.
Precision: The proportion of correctly identified positives.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix to visualize the classification performance.

Feature Importance
The following features were identified as the most important in predicting cybersecurity incidents:

EntityType (0.205) – The type of entity involved in the incident.
OrgId (0.180) – The organization associated with the incident.
CountryCode (0.150) – The country where the entity originated.
DetectorId (0.120) – The detection system identifier.
Category (0.090) – The category of the alert.
AlertTitle (0.080) – The title of the alert.
IncidentId (0.050) – The unique incident identifier.
Confusion Matrix Visualization
The confusion matrix provides insight into the model’s classification performance. While it performs well in detecting TruePositives, it struggles to some extent with correctly identifying FalsePositives, which leads to higher false alarms.

Recommendations for Microsoft
Based on the model’s performance and feature importance analysis, the following recommendations are made for Microsoft’s cybersecurity systems:

Focus on Reducing False Positives:

Observation: The model has a relatively high false positive rate (around 35,342 instances). This can overwhelm cybersecurity teams with unnecessary alerts.
Recommendation: Use additional features such as user behavior history, device information, and access frequency to further filter out benign activities from actual threats. This can be done by introducing behavior-based models or integrating anomaly detection systems to reduce false alarms.
Enhance Entity-Based Detection:

Observation: EntityType is the most important feature in the model's predictions. This suggests that focusing on the behavior and actions of specific entity types (such as users or applications) can significantly improve detection accuracy.
Recommendation: Implement entity behavior analytics (EBA) to create behavior profiles for different types of entities (e.g., users, devices). This will help identify deviations from normal behavior, reducing the chance of missed true positives.
Incorporate Real-Time Monitoring and Dynamic Features:

Observation: Static features such as OrgId, CountryCode, and AlertTitle play a critical role in incident detection.
Recommendation: Introduce real-time dynamic features such as real-time network traffic analysis, device health, and user activity. These features will help in identifying evolving threats in real time and reduce reliance on static data.
Regular Model Retraining:

Observation: The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly evolving, and the model’s performance may degrade over time.
Recommendation: Continuously update and retrain the model using recent data to ensure that it can detect emerging threats. This should include updating the feature set and using the latest incident patterns.
Ensemble Methods for Improved Accuracy:

Observation: While XGBoost performs well, there are still some misclassifications (FalsePositives and FalseNegatives).
Recommendation: Combine XGBoost with other models such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting in an ensemble framework to improve prediction accuracy and further reduce false positives.
Threshold Tuning to Adjust Sensitivity:

Observation: The model's classification thresholds are set by default to 0.5, which might not be optimal for cybersecurity use cases.
Recommendation: Fine-tune the classification thresholds based on the business need (e.g., reducing false positives might require increasing the threshold for classifying threats).
Conclusion
The XGBoost model provides a solid foundation for detecting cybersecurity incidents with high accuracy. By focusing on reducing false positives, incorporating real-time features, and leveraging ensemble models, Microsoft can further improve its security incident detection capabilities. Regular model retraining and real-time monitoring will ensure that the system stays up-to-date with the latest threats, ensuring robust protection against evolving cybersecurity challenges.
